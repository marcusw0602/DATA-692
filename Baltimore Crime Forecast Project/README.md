## This folder will contain the following on going data anaylsis report of crime within Baltimore City. I will be looking at Baltimore City's nine districts and analyze their crime levels from 2011-current. 

## I have gathered my datasets that I will be using for this report from [Open Baltimore webiste](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/browse?limitTo=datasets), this site houses datasets that Baltimore City allows citizes to review.  

## When looking into my datasets you will see 12 columns and over 500,000+ rows. Each row contains data associated to the column it is under. Below are the definitions of eacch column names: 
1. CrimeDate - The date (MM-DD-YYYY) that the crime was committed 
2. CrimeTime - The time (HH:MM:SS) in which the crime took place. 
3. CrimeCode - The two character code that is associated to the specific crime
4. Description - The actual crime name
5. Inside/Outside - An indication of whether the crime took place in or outside
6. Weapon - Used for any type of weapon used when a crime was committed
7. District - The district in Baltimore City in whihc the crime was recorded in
8. Neighborhood - The location of where the crime happened
9. Total Incidents - a value that will be set when a crime is committed
10. Hour - This column was created to store the Hour value from the CrimeTime column for plotting purposes
11. Month - This column was created to store the Month value from the CrimeTime column for plotting purposes
12. Year - This column was created to store the Year value from the CrimeTime column for plotting purposes

## I have chosen to report on Baltimore City's crime due to being a native from the area and to see if there could be any insight or discovery when doing this anaylsis. This is the first stage of the report just to do an anaylsis dive then phase two will be to tie in contributing factors such as laws, wages, and live conditions. I do believe these factors could explain or help identify why crime is high during 2011-current.
